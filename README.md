# study_Falaise

Here are collected scripts and files I created while doing the very first steps in studying Falaise.

# MiModule_DataCutCalc.cpp 
It is a script which provides data cuts for simulations via 4 criteria using MiModule which should lead to collecting the most appropriate data which correspond to bb-decay.
# 1st criteria (very rough estimation): 
to assume that we deected bb-decay we should have 2 electrons detected - so they went towards the calorimeter and hit them. So in the 1st approach we can say that we have bb-decay if there are 2 calorimiter hits (at this point we don't care about what exactl particles they were - we are interested only at that fact that they were detected by hitting while going towards the calorimiter)
